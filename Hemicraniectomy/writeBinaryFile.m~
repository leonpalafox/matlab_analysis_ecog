function writeBinaryFile(time_data , eegdata, filename, location)
%WRITEBINARYFILE creates a binary file with te format that we have been
%using in the Penn Epxeriments done in October 1st and 11th.
%WRITEBINARYFILE uses data that has been precomputed alreeady and creates
%an array of the correct format and size, the current version just puts
%zeros where the force sensor should be, this will be updated in the next
%release.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%INPUT:
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
%time_data: Holds an array of time, that can be real time (in seconds) or
%simply samples
%eegdata:Data with the format TxN where T is the time samples and N are the
%number of channels
%filename: name of the file 
%location: Set the folder where the data is to be stored, binary files may
%be large, so it is recommended that the location has enough memory.
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
%OUTPUT:
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
%It generates a binary file with the name indicated in the input, in the
%location indicated in the input
