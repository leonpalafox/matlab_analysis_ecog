%now I create dummy cloumns to complyu with the same data format that
%Mosalam has
dummy_force = repmat(labels,4,1)'; %labels variable refers to the simulated force data.

                                    %data columns with the same force data
                                    %to conform with expected data format

%now we iterate to generate the bin file
fid=fopen('dummy.bin','w');%open the file
fseek(fid,0,'bof');%go to the beginning of the file
for writing_idx=1:ntp
    fwrite(fid,time_axis(writing_idx),'uint64');
    fwrite(fid,dummy_force(writing_idx,:), 'float');
    fwrite(fid, signal_and_noise(writing_idx,:), 'float');
