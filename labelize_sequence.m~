function [labels] = labelize_sequence(data, threshold)
%Function to obtaion discrete labels from the force sensors, in this case,
%we detect the first threshold passing, instead of just comparing.
%   input:
%   data: raw data from the force sensor
%   threshold: threshold to determine when a data point is considered a one
%   Output:
%   labels: 0s and 1s, where we have 0 for not an onset and 1 for an onset
[ntp, dim] = size(data);
labels = zeros(ntp, dim); %generate the placeholder array
