%data_file = loation of the data file to segment
%size_of_batch =  size of the desired batch in seconds
%samplingRate = sampling rate of the original non decimated signal
%batch number = decide which batch of data do you wish to extract
%data_id: defines which data you want to extract, (force or eeg).
%
%if the batch number is inconsistent with the size of the batch, and error
%will be created.
%if the batch is the last one, the function will return the rest available
%data, whcih won't have the requested size because is what is left in the
%file.
%Before using the function we recomend to calculate the number of batches
%first, although if there is a mismatch, the function will indicate which is
%this.
